# **Project Title**

A short description of your project that highlights its purpose and functionality.

## **Tech Stack**

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Database:** (Insert database technology if applicable, e.g., MongoDB, MySQL)
- **Styling:** (Insert CSS framework or methodology, e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS, SASS)
- **Other Libraries/Tools:** (Any additional tools or libraries used in your project, e.g., Redux, Axios, etc.)

## **Project Overview**

Briefly explain the project's objective, features, and functionality.

For example:

This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage and track their routines. It consists of two parts:
- **Frontend:** Built with React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** Powered by Express, providing a RESTful API for handling requests, authentication, and database interactions.

## **Features**

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for users.
- **Create/Edit/Delete Routines:** Users can create, edit, and delete their routines.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile and desktop views.
- **Backend Services:** The backend handles data processing and persistence with Express.

## **Installation**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### **Frontend (React):**

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### **Backend (Express):**

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add your environment-specific variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).

4. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:5000).

## **Usage**

Once both servers are running, navigate to the frontend URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`) in your browser. You can interact with the application by creating or managing your routines. The frontend will communicate with the backend to perform CRUD operations.

### **User Authentication:**
- Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
  
### **Managing Routines:**
- Add, edit, or delete routines from your dashboard.
